            Hi everyone. I'm Volkan, a front end engineer on the Agent
            Experience team. Today I'll be talking about state management
            frameworks.

            First, we're going to define the term state management framework.
            And differentiate it from a UI framework. Next, we're going to list
            the frameworks we're going to analyze, and discuss why they were
            chosen. Then, we'll consider some evaluation criteria to guide our
            decision. And examine the design problems that these frameworks try
            to solve. Finally, we're going to take a close look at a small
            project using each of these frameworks to better understand the
            design choices they have made and their tradeoffs.

          <p>
            A <b>reactive</b> library for changing the global data store that
            drives your app.

            <p>State manager is...</p>
            <p>
              Reactive is another way of saying it emits an event when it
              changes. These events are used by the UI framework to determine
              whether to render the component in the browser. Second thing to
              note here is the word global, as opposed to state local to a
              component. Most UI frameworks provide local state management, and
              some even provide global state management, and we're going to talk
              about some of those next.

              There are hundreds of frameworks, but I'm going to be analyzing
              only 4 today. They made the cut because they're popular or have
              some feature that make them stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone here probably knows or have used Flux and Redux. Flux
              started as a separate state management framework back in 2015 but
              was integrated into React over the years. Redux built on Flux
              architecture and is probably the most popular and well known
              framework today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Others, like Zustand and Valtio, are newcomers, but they have some
              features that make them viable alternatives.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Over-rendering happens when the state manager does not send
                notifications strategically. We'll see examples of that and why
                this is a problem in a bit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under rendering can happen in frameworks that use immutable data
                stores. If you mutate an object in place, rather than creating a
                new object, it can cause under-rendering.

            <h4>Design Choices: Shallow object comparison</h4>
            <small>Redux</small>

            <pre><code class="language-jsx" data-trim>
              // combineReducers.ts
              hasChanged = nextStateForKey !== previousStateForKey
              return hasChanged ? nextState : state
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Redux checks the object identity of the next state to the
                previous state to decide whether the data store has changed. The
                stored object must be immutable to make this happen. With this
                approach, we don't know which field did change. We only know
                that a change has occurred.
              </p>
              <p>
                This design choice can lead to over-rendering. Libraries that
                use this technique are often used with an additional abstraction
                called a selector library. We're going to see an example of that
                later.

            <h4>Design Choices: Field level comparison</h4>
            <small>Valtio</small>
            <pre><code class="language-jsx" data-trim>
              set(target, prop, value) {
                const prevValue = target[prop]
                if (Object.is(prevValue, value)) return true
                target[prop] = value
                notifyUpdate()
              }
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              Valtio is a proxy based state management framework. It works by
              wrapping the data store inside a Javascript Proxy object. As you
              can see here, the setter on the Proxy is aware of the previous
              value of the field, its name, and its next value, so it can
              compare whether the value has changed, not at state level, but at
              the field level -- so it's much more granular. As you will see,
              this granularity makes some interesting features possible.

                const reducer = (state, action) => { 
                  switch(action.type) {
                    case 'INC':
                      state = { count: state.count + 1 } 
                      break;
                    default:
                      break;
                  }
                  return state;
                };
                const store = createStore(reducer, { count: 0 });
                store.dispatch({ type: 'INC' })

            <aside class="notes">
              Indirect manipulation is a design choice that's adopted by state
              management frameworks that require an immutable data store, such
              as Flux and Redux. Since we can't mutate the data in place, we
              have to replace it. Redux creates an abstraction layer over the
              stored data, so you can only manipulate your data only using a
              reducer or middlewares with a message sent through a dispatcher.
              The tradeoff is simplicity. You have to write a dozen lines of
              boilerplate to mutate a field.

            <aside class="notes">
              Zustand also uses indirect manipulation, but its syntax is a bit
              simpler than Redux. As you can see, we wrote a method called inc
              that uses the internal mutator function, set, to increment the
              count field. It's a thin abstraction, but it's still more complex
              than it could be.
